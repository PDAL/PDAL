#
# PCL plugin CMake configuration
#
# The PCL integration still has a few warts that need to be resolved:
#
#     1. src/kernel/Kernel.cpp requires PCL for invoking the PCLVisualizer with
#        two point buffers.
#
#        This is currently disabled (commented out), and should be somehow
#        fully integrated as a plugin behavior.
#
#     2. PCL unit tests still live within main test directory.
#
#        We should be able to move plugin tests to plugin directories without
#        too much hassle. PCL unit tests will pass with a warning if the PCL
#        plugins are not installed in PDAL_DRIVER_PATH (just assumes you didn't
#        intend to test with PCL support).
