/**
The objective is to split the region into non-overlapping blocks, each
containing approximately the same number of points, as specified by the
user.  We'd also like the blocks closer to square than not.

First, the points are read into arrays - one for the x direction, and one for
the y direction.  The arrays are sorted and are initialized with indices into
the other array of the location of the other coordinate of the same point.

Partitions are created that place the maximum number of points in a
block, subject to the user-defined threshold, using a cumulate and round
procedure.

The distance of the point-space is checked in each direction and the
wider dimension is chosen for splitting at an appropriate partition point.
The points in the narrower direction are copied to locations in the spare
array at one side or the other of the chosen partition, and that portion
of the spare array then becomes the active array for the narrow direction.
This avoids resorting of the arrays, which are already sorted.

This procedure is then recursively applied to the created blocks until
they contains only one or two partitions.  In the case of one partition,
we are done, and we simply store away the contents of the block.  If there are
two partitions in a block, we avoid the recopying the narrow array to the
spare since the wide array already contains the desired points partitioned
into two blocks.  We simply need to locate the maximum and minimum values
from the narrow array so that the approriate extrema of the block can
be stored.
