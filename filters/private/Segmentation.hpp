  Extract clusters of points from input PointView.

  For each point, find neighbors within a given tolerance (Euclidean distance).
  If a neighbor already belongs to another cluster, skip it. Otherwise, add it
  to the current cluster. Recursively visit newly added cluster points, looking
  for neighbors to add to the cluster.

  \param[in] view the input PointView.
  \param[in] min_points the minimum number of points in a cluster.
  \param[in] max_points the maximum number of points in a cluster.
  \param[in] tolerance the tolerance for adding points to a cluster.
  \returns a vector of clusters (themselves vectors of PointIds).
