# Community

PDAL's community interacts through [Mailing List], [GitHub], and [Matrix].
Please feel welcome to ask questions and participate in all of the venues.  The
[Mailing List] communication channel is for general questions, development
discussion, and feedback. The [GitHub] communication channel is for development
activities, bug reports, and testing. The [Matrix] channel is for
real-time chat activities such as meetings and interactive debugging sessions.

## Mailing List

Developers and users of PDAL participate on the PDAL mailing list. It is OK to
ask questions about how to use PDAL, how to integrate PDAL into your own software,
and report issues that you might have.

<http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/pdal>

```{note}
Please remember that an email to the PDAL list is going to 100s of
individuals. Do your diligence the best you can on your question before
asking, but don't be afraid to ask. We won't bite. Promise.
```

## GitHub

Visit <http://github.com/PDAL/PDAL> to file issues you might be having with the
software. GitHub is also where you can obtain a current development version of the
software in the [git] revision control system. The PDAL project is eager to
take contributions in all forms, and we welcome those who are willing to roll
up their sleeves and start filing tickets, pushing code, generating builds, and
answering questions.

```{seealso}
{ref}`development_index` provides more information on how the PDAL software
development activities operate.
```

## Matrix

Some PDAL developers are active on [Matrix] and you can use that mechanism for
asking questions and interacting with the developers in a mode that is similar
to [IRC]. Matrix requires [OSGeo credentials] for access, so you will need an
account to get started.  The [Mailing List] and [GitHub] avenues are going to
be more productive communication channels in most situations.
