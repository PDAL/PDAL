PDAL is a C++ `BSD`_ library for translating and manipulating `point cloud data`_.
It is very much like the `GDAL`_ library which handles raster and vector data.
See :ref:`readers` and :ref:`writers` for data formats PDAL supports, and see
:ref:`filters` for filtering operations that you can apply with PDAL.

In addition to the library code, PDAL provides a suite of command-line
applications that users can conveniently use to process, filter, translate, and
query point cloud data.  See :ref:`apps` for more information.

PDAL is developed by `Howard Butler`_, `Michael Gerlek`_, `Andrew Bell`_,
`Brad Chambers`_ and `others`_. Find out more about who contributes to
PDAL at :ref:`contributors`.


.. note::

    PDAL should not be confused with `PCL`_ (Point Cloud Library).  PCL is a
    library specifically designed to provide algorithmic analysis and
    modification of point clouds.  PDAL provides a limited interface to the
    facilities of PCL, but does not in general attempt to duplicate its
    capabilites.  PDAL is focused more on data access and translation than
    PCL. See :ref:`filters.pclblock` for more background.
