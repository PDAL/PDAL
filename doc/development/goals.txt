Project Goals
=============

1. PDAL is a library which provides APIs for reading, writing, and 
   processing geospatial point cloud data of various formats.  Additionally,
   some command line tools are provided.  As GDAL is to 2D pixels, PDAL is to 
   multidimensional points.
    
2. From a market perspective, PDAL is "version 2" of libLAS.  The actual 
   code base will be different, however, and the APIs will not be
   compatible.

3. The PDAL implementation has high performance, yet the API remains 
   flexible.  We recognize that these two goals will conflict at times and 
   will weigh the tradeoffs pragmatically.
  
4. The architecture of a PDAL-based workflow will be a pipeline of 
   connected stages, each stage being either a data source (such as a file
   reader), a filter (such as a point thinner), or data sink (such as a
   file writer).

5. The PDAL library will be in C++, but will have SWIG bindings for languages
   like Python and C#. PDAL will support multiple platforms, specifically
   Windows, Linux, and Mac.

6. PDAL is open source and is released under a BSD license.
