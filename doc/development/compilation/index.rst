This section describes how to build and install PDAL under Windows, Linux, and Mac.
PDAL's numerous :ref:`dependencies` can make it a challenge to build a fully-featured
build.

.. seealso::
    :ref:`download` contains links to installable binaries for Windows, OSX, and
    RHEL Linux systems.

.. seealso::
    :ref:`docker` describes how to use `Docker <http://docker.io>`__  to
    get going with PDAL very quickly. This method is likely the fastest way
    to start using PDAL, especially if you just wish to use the :ref:`apps`.
