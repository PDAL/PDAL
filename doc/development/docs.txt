Docs
====

PDAL comes with a few different types of documentation:

* the API reference documentation

* the command line applications user manual

* Tutorials and Examples

* the Developer Notes

This documentation is all provided on the website, via Sphinx.


API Documentation
=================

The API docs will be autogenerated by doxygen from the 
header files.

See the Note on Coding Conventions for information on what syntax to use
for this.


Command Line Apps
=================

The command line apps are documented via Sphinx using RST markup.


Tutorials and Examples
======================

Similar to how libLAS was done, the PDAL website will contain a set of simple
code fragments that show how to do basic operations using PDAL.

This documentation will also include sample Python/C# code.


Developer Notes
===============

All development-related documentation, such as design notes, coding
conventions, and so on, will be documented in a Development Notes
section of the PDAL website, via Sphinx using RST markup.


Building the Documentation
==========================

To build the PDAL documentation yourself, you need to install sphinx_, breathe_, and other python dependencies, preferably with PyPI_.
If you have `pip installed <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html>`_, install the documentation dependencies with:

.. code-block:: bash

    (sudo) pip install sphinx breathe rst2pdf

If you are installing these packages to a system-wide directory, you may need the **sudo** in front of the **pip**, though it might be better that instead you use `virtual environments`_ instead of installing the packages system-wide.

The PDAL documentation also depends on `doxygen`_, which can be installed from source or from binaries from the `doxygen website <http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html>`_.
If you are on Max OS X and use `homebrew`_, you can install doxygen with a simple ``brew install doxygen``.

Once you have installed all the doc dependencies, you can then build the documentation itself.
The :file:`doc/` directory in the PDAL source tree contains a Makefile which can be used to build all documentation.
For a list of the output formats supported by Sphinx, simply type ``make``.
For example, to build html documentation:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd doc
    make doxygen html

The html docs will be placed in :file:`doc/build/html/`.
The ``make doxygen`` is necessary to re-generate the API documentation from the source code.
