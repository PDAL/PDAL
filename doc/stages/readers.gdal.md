# readers.gdal

The [GDAL] reader reads [GDAL readable raster] data sources as point clouds.

Each pixel is given an X and Y coordinate (and corresponding PDAL dimensions)
that are center pixel, and each band is represented by "band-1", "band-2", or
"band-n".  Using the 'header' option allows naming the band data to standard
PDAL dimensions.

```{eval-rst}
.. embed::
```

## Basic Example

Simply writing every pixel of a JPEG to a text file is not very useful.

```json
[
    {
        "type":"readers.gdal",
        "filename":"./pdal/test/data/autzen/autzen.jpg"
    },
    {
        "type":"writers.text",
        "filename":"outputfile.txt"
    }
]
```

## LAS Example

The following example assigns the bands from a JPG to the
RGB values of an [ASPRS LAS] file using {ref}`writers.las`.

```json
[
    {
        "type":"readers.gdal",
        "filename":"./pdal/test/data/autzen/autzen.jpg",
        "header": "Red, Green, Blue"
    },
    {
        "type":"writers.las",
        "filename":"outputfile.las"
    }
]
```

```{note}
{ref}`readers.gdal` is quite sensitive to GDAL's cache settings. See the
`GDAL_CACHEMAX` value at <https://gdal.org/user/configoptions.html> for
more information.
```

## Options

filename

: [GDALOpen] 'able raster file to read \[Required\]

```{include} reader_opts.md
```

header

: A comma-separated list of {ref}`dimension <dimensions>` IDs to map
  bands to. The length of the list must match the number
  of bands in the raster.

memorycopy

: Use the [GDAL MEM driver](https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/mem.html)
  to copy the entire raster into memory before converting to points. This
  is useful if the raster driver has a lot of per-block overhead or you
  are willing to trade memory for performance.

gdalopts

: A list of key/value options to pass directly to the GDAL driver.  The
  format is name=value,name=value,...  The option may be specified
  any number of times.
