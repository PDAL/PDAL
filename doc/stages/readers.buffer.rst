drivers.buffer.reader
================================================================================

The `drivers.buffer.reader`_ stage is a special stage that allows
you to read data from your own PointBuffer rather than
fetching the data from a specific reader. In the `writing`_ example,
it is used to take a simple listing of points and turn them into an
LAS file.
