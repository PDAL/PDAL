Filters
=======

Filters operate on data as inline operations. They can remove, modify,
reorganize, and add points to the data stream as it goes by. Some filters can
only operate on dimensions they understand (consider :ref:`filters.reprojection`
doing geographic reprojection on XYZ coordinates), while others do not
interrogate the point data at all and simply reorganize or split data.

Create
------

PDAL filters commonly create new dimensions (e.g., ``HeightAboveGround``) or
alter existing ones (e.g., ``Classification``). These filters will not
invalidate an existing KD-tree.

.. note::

  We treat those filters that alter XYZ coordinates separately.

.. note::

  When creating new dimensions, be mindful of the writer you are using and
  whether or not the custom dimension can be written to disk if that is the
  desired behavior.

Order
-----

There are currently three PDAL filters that can be used to reorder points. These
filters will invalidate an existing KD-tree.

.. toctree::

   :hidden:

   filters.mortonorder

   filters.sort

Move
----

PDAL filters that move XYZ coordinates will invalidate an existing KD-tree.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   :glob:
   :hidden:

   filters.cpd
   filters.icp
   filters.reprojection

Cull
----

Some PDAL filters will cull points, returning a point cloud that is smaller than
the input. These filters will invalidate an existing KD-tree.
