===============================================================================

The **Divider Filter** breaks a point view into a set of smaller point views
based on simple criteria.  The number of subsets can be specified explicitly,
or one can specify a maximum point count for each subset.  Additionally,
points can be placed into each subset sequentially (as they appear in the
input) or in round-robin fashion.

Normally points are divided into subsets to facilitate output by writers
that support creating multiple output files with a template (LAS and BPF
are notable examples).

Example
-------

This pipeline will create 10 output files from the input file readers.las.

.. code-block:: json

  [
      "example.las",
      {
          "type":"filters.divider",
          "count":"10"
      },
      {
          "type":"writers.las",
          "filename":"out_#.las"
      }
  ]

Options
-------

_`mode`
  A mode of "partition" will write sequential points to an output view until
  the view meets its predetermined size. "round_robin" mode will iterate
  through the output views as it writes sequential points.
  [Default: "partition"]

_`count`
  Number of output views.  [Default: none]

_`capacity`
  Maximum number of points in each output view.  Views will contain
  approximately equal numbers of points.  [Default: none]

.. warning::

    You must specify exactly one of either count_ or capacity_.
