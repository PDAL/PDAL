===========

The **LAS Reader** supports reading from `LAS format`_ files, the standard
interchange format for LIDAR data.  The reader does NOT support point formats
containing waveform data (4, 5, 9 and 10).

The reader will accept version 1.4 LAS files and will interpret the extra bytes
VLR (User ID: LASF_Spec, Record ID: 4) if present.  Two dimensions are
created for each
extra byte field with types 11 - 20, "0" and "1" being appended to the field
name to create the dimension names. Three dimensions are created for each
extra byte field with types 21-30, "0", "1" and "2" being appended to the field
name to create the dimension names.  Field type 0 is understood, but the data
associated with field type 0 is ignored (no PDAL dimension is created).  The
presence of this VLR overrides the **extra_dims** option.

Example
-------

.. code-block:: xml

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
  <Pipeline version="1.0">
    <Writer type="writers.text">
      <Option name="filename">outputfile.txt</Option>
      <Reader type="readers.las">
        <Option name="filename">inputfile.las</Option>
      </Reader>
    </Writer>
  </Pipeline>

Options
-------

filename
  LAS file to read [Required] 

extra_dims
  Extra dimensions to be read as part of each point beyond those specified by
  the LAS point format.  The format of the option is
  <dimension_name>=<type>, ... where type is one of:
      int8, int16, int32, int64, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, float, double
  '_t' may be added to any of the type names as well (e.g., uint32_t)

compression
  May be set to "lazperf" or "laszip" to choose either the LazPerf decompressor
  or the LasZip decompressor for LAZ files.  PDAL must have been build with
  support for the decompressor being requested.  The LazPerf decompressor
  doesn't support version 1 LAZ files or version 1.4 of LAS.
  [Default: "laszip"]
