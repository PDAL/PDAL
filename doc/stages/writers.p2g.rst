writers.p2g
===========

The **points to grid writer** takes in a stream of point data and writes out
gridded summaries of the stream. Each cell in the output grids can give one of
the: minimum value, maximum value, average value, average value, inverse
distance weighted interpolation (for sparse points), or density. The points to
grid writer supports creating multiple output grids simultaneously, so it is
possible to generate all grid variants in one pass.


.. note::

    A project called `lidar2dems`_ by `Applied GeoSolutions`_ integrates the P2G
    writer and other PDAL components into a series of scripts and utilities that
    make it more convenient to do DEM production with PDAL.
