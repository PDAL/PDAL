===============================================================================

The Height Above Ground (HAG) filter takes as input a point cloud with a
Classification dimension, with ground points assigned the classification label
of 2 (per LAS specification). It returns a point cloud with a new dimension
``HeightAboveGround`` that contains the normalized height value.

The HAG filter works by iterating through all non-ground points, finding the
nearest neighbor (in XY only) amongst the ground points, and computing the
distance between the two Z values.
