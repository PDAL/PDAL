filters.normal
===============================================================================

``filters.normal`` returns the estimated normal and curvature for a collection
of points. The algorithm first computes the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the
collection of points, which is comprised of the k-nearest neighbors. The normal
is taken as the eigenvector corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue. The
curvature is computed as

.. math::

  curvature = \frac{\lambda_0}{\lambda_0 + \lambda_1 + \lambda_2}

where :math:`\lambda_i` are the eigenvalues sorted in ascending order.

The filter produces four new dimensions (``NormalX``, ``NormalY``, ``NormalZ``,
and ``Curvature``), which can be analyzed directly, or consumed by downstream
stages for more advanced filtering.

The eigenvalue decomposition is performed using Eigen's
``SelfAdjointEigenSolver``. For more information see

Example
-------

This pipeline demonstrates the calculation of the normal values (along with
curvature). The newly created dimensions are written out to BPF for further
inspection.
