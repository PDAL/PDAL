filters.stats
===============================================================================

The stats filter calculates the minimum, maximum and average (mean) values
of dimensions.  On request it will also provide an enumeration of values of
a dimension.

The output of the stats filter is metadata that can be stored by writers or
used through the PDAL API.  Output from the stats filter can also be
quickly obtained in JSON format by using the command ``pdal info --stats``.


Example

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "pipeline":[
        "input.las",
        {
          "type":"filters.stats",
          "dimensions":"X,Y,Z,Classification",
          "enumerate":"Classification"
        },
        {
          "type":"writers.las",
          "filename":"output.las"
        }
      ]
    }

  Note that this list does not add to the list of dimensions that may be
  provided in the **dimensions** option.
