# filters.chipper

The **Chipper Filter** takes a single large point cloud and converts it
into a set
of smaller clouds, or chips. The chips are all spatially contiguous and
non-overlapping, so the result is an irregular tiling of the input data.

```{note}
Each chip will have approximately, but not exactly, the [capacity] point
count specified.
```

```{seealso}
The {ref}`PDAL split command <split_command>` utilizes the
{ref}`filters.chipper` to split data by capacity.
```

:scale: 100 %

Before chipping, the points are all in one collection.
```

```{figure} filters.chipper.img2.png
:alt: Points after chipping
:scale: 100 %

After chipping, the points are tiled into smaller contiguous chips.
```

Chipping is usually applied to data read from files (which produce one large
stream of points) before the points are written to a database (which prefer
data segmented into smaller blocks).

## Example

```json
[
    "example.las",
    {
        "type":"filters.chipper",
        "capacity":"400"
    },
    {
        "type":"writers.pgpointcloud",
        "connection":"dbname='lidar' user='user'"
    }
]
```

## Options

`` _`capacity` ``

: How many points to fit into each chip. The number of points in each chip will
  not exceed this value, and will sometimes be less than it. \[Default: 5000\]
