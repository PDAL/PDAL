# readers.ptx

The **PTX reader** reads data from [Leica Cyclone PTX] files. It infers
dimensions from points stored in a text file.

```{note}
PTX files can contain multiple point clouds stored in a single
file.  If that is the case, the reader will read all the points
from all of the internal point clouds as one.
