PDAL is a C++ library for translating and manipulating [point cloud
data][point cloud data].  It is very much like the [GDAL] library which handles raster and
vector data.  The {ref}`about` page provides high level overview of the library
and its philosophy. Visit {ref}`readers` and {ref}`writers` to list data
formats it supports, and see {ref}`filters` for filtering operations that you
can apply with PDAL.

In addition to the library code, PDAL provides a suite of command-line
applications that users can conveniently use to process, filter, translate, and
query point cloud data.  {ref}`apps` provides more information on that topic.

Finally, PDAL speaks Python by both embedding and extending it. Visit
{ref}`python` to find out how you can use PDAL with Python to process point
cloud data.

The entire website is available as a single PDF at <http://pdal.io/_/downloads/en/latest/pdf/>
