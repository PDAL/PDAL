Batch Processing
==================


PDAL doesn't handle matching multiple file inputs except for glob handling for merge operations,
but does allow for command line substitution parameters to make batch processing simpler,  
substitutions. Substitions work with both :ref:`pipeline` operations as well as with 
other applications such as :ref:`translate`. 


Operating system variations
-----------------------------


How substitutions are passed generally depends on the operating system and tools available.
In the unix/linux environments, this is primarily using the `find` and `ls` programs to get
lists of files (either with directories or just filenames) and the `xargs` program to pass 
those files to the :ref:`pdal` application (although `-exec` with `find` can also be used). These
tools are available in the `docker` environment if you are running `PDAL` under docker. They
are also available under Windows one installs `Cygwin` or `MinGW`. They are also available if
Git for Windows is installed. They are also available as win32 command line programs installed
from the GNU Findutils (https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/findutils.html). 


Windows native tools
-----------------------

Subtitions can be handled directly in windows using `PowerShell` syntax. 

While there are a number of ways to generate lists of files, the `Get-ChildItem` is used here,
along with the `foreach` option to pass each separate filepath to the pdal application.


Example - Batch compression of LAS files to LAZ:
---------------------------------------------------

To compress a series of LAS files in one directory into compressed LAZ files in another 
directory, the `PowerShell` syntax would be:


.. code-block:: powershell
  
  Get-ChildItem .\DIR1\*.las | foreach {pdal translate -i .\DIR1\$($_.BaseName).las -o .\DIR2\$($_.BaseName).laz}

Note the use of the `$($_.BaseName)` syntax for the files passed. This option on the `$($_)` shortcut for 
the full filename, removes the directory and the extension on the file and allows the user to set 
the path and extension manually. 


The resulting 4 DTMs in QGIS look like:

.. image:: ../../../images/dtm-batch-result.png



Example - Parallel Batch compression of LAS files to LAZ:
------------------------------------------------------------

This use of the `PowerShell` syntax doesn't allow a user to execute more than one process at a
time. There is a free download of the `xargs` program that provides parallel execution available 
at http://www.pirosa.co.uk/demo/wxargs/ppx2.exe. For this tool, the file names are passed with 
using the `{}` syntax. 

.. code-block:: powershell

  Get-ChildItem .\dir1\ | Select-Object -ExpandProperty BaseName | .\ppx2.exe -P 3 pdal translate -i ".\dir1\{}.las" -o ".\dir2\{}.laz"`


Exercise - Pipeline Substitions:
----------------------------------

For the most flexibility, pipelines are used to apply a series of opertations to a file (or group
of files). In this excersise, we build on the :ref:`workshop-dtm` pipeline example, but run this pipline over 4 files and
reproject, calculate a bare earth using the :ref:`filters.smrf` filter, remove those points that aren't bare earth
with :ref:`filters.range` and then write the output using the :ref:`writers.gdal`.

The pipeline we are using is:


.. include:: ./batch_srs_gdal.json
    :literal:

You might have spotted that this pipeline doesn't have any input or output file references, or a value for the 
output spatial reference. We will be adding those at the command line, not within the actual pipeline and 
using the substitutions syntax to do this. 

.. code-block:: powershell

  $env:PATH="$PATH;C:\OSGeo4W64\bin\"
  $env:GDAL_DATA="C:\OSGeo4W64\share\gdal\"

  PS C:\Users\hobu\exercises\batch> Get-ChildItem  C:\Users\administrator\exercises\batch\ll\*.laz | foreach {pdal pipeline C:\Users\hobu\exercises\batch\batch_srs_gdal.json --readers.las.filename=.\ll\$($_.BaseName).laz --writers.gdal.filename=.\dtm\$($_.BaseName).tif --filters.reprojection.out_srs=epsg:26919}
