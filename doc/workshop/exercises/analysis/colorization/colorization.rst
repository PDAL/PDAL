Colorizing points with imagery
================================================================================

.. include:: ../../../includes/substitutions.rst

.. index:: Colorization, GDAL, Raster, RGB

This exercise uses PDAL to apply color information from a raster onto point
data. Point cloud data, especially |LiDAR|, do not often have coincident color
information. It is possible to project color information onto the points from
an imagery source. This makes it convenient to see data in a larger context.


Exercise
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PDAL provides a :ref:`filter <filters>` to apply color information from
raster files onto point cloud data. Think of this operation as a top-down
projection of RGB color values on the points.

Because this operation is somewhat complex, we are going to use a pipeline
to define it.


.. literalinclude:: ./colorize.json
    :linenos:

.. note::

    This JSON file is available in your workshop materials in the
    ``./exercises/analysis/colorization/colorize.json`` file. Remember to
    open this file and replace each occurrence of ``./``
    with the correct path for your machine.

Pipeline breakdown
................................................................................

1. Reader
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After our pipeline errata, the first item we define in the pipeline is the
point cloud file we're going to read.

::

    "./exercises/analysis/colorization/uncompahgre.laz",

2. :ref:`filters.colorization`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`filters.colorization` PDAL filter does most of the work for this
operation. We're going to use the default data scaling options. This
filter will create PDAL dimensions ``Red``, ``Green``, and ``Blue``.

::

    {
        "type": "filters.colorization",
        "raster": "./exercises/analysis/colorization/casi-2015-04-29-weekly-mosaic.tif"
    },


3. :ref:`filters.range`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A small challenge is the raster will colorize many points with NODATA values.
We are going to use the :ref:`filters.range` to filter keep any points that
have ``Red >= 1``.

::

    {
        "type": "filters.range",
        "limits": "Red[1:]"
    },

4. :ref:`writers.las`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We could just define the ``uncompahgre-colored.laz`` filename, but we want to
add a few options to have finer control over what is written. These include:

::

    {
        "type": "writers.las",
        "compression": "true",
        "minor_version": "2",
        "dataformat_id": "3",
        "filename":"./exercises/colorization/analysis/uncompahgre-colored.laz"
    }

1. ``compression``: |LASzip| data is ~6x smaller than ASPRS LAS.
2. ``minor_version``: We want to make sure to output LAS 1.2, which will
   provide the widest compatibility with other softwares that can
   consume LAS.
3. ``dataformat_id``: Format 3 supports both time and color information

.. note::

    :ref:`writers.las` provides a number of possible options to control
    how your LAS files are written.

Execution
................................................................................

Invoke the following command, substituting accordingly, in your |Terminal|:


.. literalinclude:: ./colorization-run-command.txt
    :linenos:

.. image:: ../../../images/colorize-run-command.png

Visualization
................................................................................

Use one of the point cloud visualization tools you installed to take a look at
your ``uncompahgre-colored.laz`` output. In the example below, we simply
opened the file using the http://plas.io website.

.. image:: ../../../images/colorize-umpaghre-colored.png


Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. Applying color information that is not time-coincident with the point cloud
   data will mean you will see discontinuities.

2. GDAL is used to read the image source. Any GDAL-readable data format
   can be used.

3. There are performance considerations to be aware of depending on the
   raster format and type being used. See :ref:`filters.colorization`
   for more information.
