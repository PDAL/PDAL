# filters.outlier

The **outlier filter** provides two outlier filtering methods: radius and
statistical. These two approaches are discussed in further detail below.

It is worth noting that both filtering methods simply apply a classification
value of 7 to the noise points (per the [LAS specification]).
To remove the noise
points altogether, users can add a {ref}`range filter<filters.range>` to their
pipeline, downstream from the outlier filter.

```{eval-rst}
.. embed::
```

```json
{
  "type":"filters.range",
  "limits":"Classification![7:7]"
}
```

## Statistical Method

The default method for identifying outlier points is the statistical outlier method. This method requires two passes through the input `PointView`, first to compute a threshold value based on global statistics, and second to identify outliers using the computed threshold.

In the first pass, for each point $p_i$ in the input `PointView`, compute the mean distance $\mu_i$ to each of the $k$ nearest neighbors (where $k$ is configurable and specified by [mean_k]). Then,

$$
\overline{\mu} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \mu_i
$$

$$
\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^N (\mu_i - \overline{\mu})^2}
$$

A global mean $\overline{\mu}$ of these mean distances is then computed along with the standard deviation $\sigma$. From this, the threshold is computed as

$$
t = \mu + m\sigma
$$

where $m$ is a user-defined multiplier specified by [multiplier].

We now iterate over the pre-computed mean distances $\mu_i$ and compare to computed threshold value. If $\mu_i$ is greater than the threshold, it is marked as an outlier.

$$
outlier_i = \begin{cases}
    \text{true,} \phantom{false,} \text{if } \mu_i >= t \\
    \text{false,} \phantom{true,} \text{otherwise} \\
\end{cases}
$$

Before outlier removal, noise points can be found both above and below the
scene.

After outlier removal, the noise points are removed.

See {cite:p}`rusu2008towards` for more information.

### Example

In this example, points are marked as outliers if the average distance to each
of the 12 nearest neighbors is below the computed threshold.

```json
[
    "input.las",
    {
        "type":"filters.outlier",
        "method":"statistical",
        "mean_k":12,
        "multiplier":2.2
    },
    "output.las"
]
```

## Radius Method

For each point $p_i$ in the input `PointView`, this method counts the
number of neighboring points $k_i$ within radius $r$ (specified by
[radius]). If $k_i<k_{min}$, where $k_{min}$ is the minimum number
of neighbors specified by [min_k], it is marked as an outlier.

$$
outlier_i = \begin{cases}
    \text{true,} \phantom{false,} \text{if } k_i < k_{min} \\
    \text{false,} \phantom{true,} \text{otherwise} \\
\end{cases}
$$

### Example

The following example will mark points as outliers when there are fewer than
four neighbors within a radius of 1.0.

```json
[
    "input.las",
    {
        "type":"filters.outlier",
        "method":"radius",
        "radius":1.0,
        "min_k":4
    },
    "output.las"
]
```
