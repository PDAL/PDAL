@article{Myronenko,
  abstract = {Point set registration is a key component in many computer vision tasks. The goal of point set registration is to assign correspondences between two sets of points and to recover the transformation that maps one point set to the other. Multiple factors, including an unknown nonrigid spatial transformation, large dimensionality of point set, noise, and outliers, make the point set registration a challenging problem. We introduce a probabilistic method, called the Coherent Point Drift (CPD) algorithm, for both rigid and nonrigid point set registration. We consider the alignment of two point sets as a probability density estimation problem. We fit the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) centroids (representing the first point set) to the data (the second point set) by maximizing the likelihood. We force the GMM centroids to move coherently as a group to preserve the topological structure of the point sets. In the rigid case, we impose the coherence constraint by reparameterization of GMM centroid locations with rigid parameters and derive a closed form solution of the maximization step of the EM algorithm in arbitrary dimensions. In the nonrigid case, we impose the coherence constraint by regularizing the displacement field and using the variational calculus to derive the optimal transformation. We also introduce a fast algorithm that reduces the method computation complexity to linear. We test the CPD algorithm for both rigid and nonrigid transformations in the presence of noise, outliers, and missing points, where CPD shows accurate results and outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.},

@article{Xuechen2019,
  abstract = {The rigid registration of two 3D point sets is a fundamental problem in
  computer vision. The current trend is to solve this problem globally using the
  BnB optimization framework. However, the existing global methods are slow for
  two main reasons: the computational complexity of BnB is exponential to the
  problem dimensionality (which is six for 3D rigid registration), and the bound
  evaluation used in BnB is inefficient. In this paper, we propose two
  techniques to address these problems. First, we introduce the idea of
  translation invariant vectors, which allows us to decompose the search of a 6D
  rigid transformation into a search of 3D rotation followed by a search of 3D
  translation, each of which is solved by a separate BnB algorithm. This
  transformation decomposition reduces the problem dimensionality of BnB
  algorithms and substantially improves its efficiency. Then, we propose a new
  data structure, named 3D Integral Volume, to accelerate the bound evaluation
  in both BnB algorithms. By combining these two techniques, we implement an
  efficient algorithm for rigid registration of 3D point sets. Extensive
  experiments on both synthetic and real data show that the proposed algorithm
  is three orders of magnitude faster than the existing state-of-the-art global
  methods.},
