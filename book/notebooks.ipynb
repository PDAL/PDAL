    "\n",
    "This tutorial describes how to use [Conda], [Entwine], [PDAL], and [GDAL] to\n",
    "read data from the [USGS 3DEP AWS Public Dataset]. We will be using PDAL's\n",
    "[readers.ept] to fetch data, we will filter it for noise using [filters.outlier],\n",
    "we will classify the data as ground/not-ground using [filters.smrf], and we will\n",
    "write out a digital terrain model with {ref}`writers.gdal`. Once our elevation model\n",
    "is constructed, we will use GDAL [gdaldem] operations to create hillshade, slope,\n",
    "and color relief.\n",
