1.1.0:

Enhancements:

- Add support for the LAZperf LAS compressor in decoding/encoding LAS files.
  LAZperf can be enabled with the 'compression' option in readers.las and
  writers.las.
- Add PCL functionality as filters (filters.greedyprojection,
  filters.gridprojection, filters.ground filters.movingleastsquares,
  filters.poisson, filters.radiusoutlier, filters.statisticaloutlier,
  filters.voxelgrid, filters.height, filters.dartsample)
- Add readers.gdal to support reading raster sets as point clouds
- Update writers.geowave and readers.geowave to work with the latest version
  of GeoWave software.
- Add readers.ilvis2 to support the Icebridge ILVIS2 format.
- Disallow nested options.  Check stage documentation for changes in option
  names and handling. (filters.ferry, filters.colorization, filters.attribute,
  filters.crop).  Change filters.attribute to handle only a single dimension.
- Add 'output_dims' options in writers.bpf to allow control of the dimensions
  that should be written.
- Add 'all' keyword in 'extra_dims' options of writers.las to cause all
  dimensions to be written to either the standard or extra dimensions of
  a LAS point.
- Add filters.randomize to allow randomized order of points.
- Add filters.divider to split a set of points into subsets of a fixed number
  or into subsets containing a specific number of points.
- Update to version 1.1.4 of rply in readers.rply.
- Change the logic of the range filter to allow multiple ranges for a single
  dimension and support a simple boolean logic.
- Change the default scaling on writer.bpf to 'auto'.
- Add support for smoothing boundaries generated by filters.hexbin.
- Add readers.tindex to allow vector-filtered input of point cloud files.
- Allow merging of datasets with non-matching spatial references.
- Many, many documentation enhancements.

Fixes:

- Handle error with Pgpointcloud when pointcloud extension is not installed
  on postgres server.  Skip tests if extention is missing.
- Set precision on output of doubles to metadata.
- Fix a divide-by-zero error in readers.faux when the point count was 1.

- Fix fatal error loading numpy library that occurred when running
  filters.predicate or filters.programmable.
  (https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/issues/1010)
- Correct readers.las to properly check WKT bit when choosing spatial
  reference VLR.
  (https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/issues/1040)
- Correct writer.las to emit only WKT or GeoTiff VLR, not both.

- Check object ID against table column id (attrelid) to ensure correct PCID
  retrieval in readers.pgpointcloud.
