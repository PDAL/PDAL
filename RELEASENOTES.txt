================================================================================

Changes of Note
===============

================================================================================
2.1.0
================================================================================

Changes of Note
===============

   double-precision floating point. This was normally case previously,
   but it is now enforced. (#2892)

   projects using cmake, eliminating the need to explicitly set the
   location of PDAL header files. (#2262)
-  PDAL is now always built using the arbiter library, which is included
   in the source distribution.

   volume, the filter now does 3D cropping, rather than 2D cropping as
   in previous releases. (#2904)
-  ``writers.ply`` no longer accepts ``default`` as a valid value for
   the ``storage_mode`` option. (#2385)

API User Notes
==============

-  Support has been added for range-based iteration of PointView
   objects. The dereferenced iterator yields a PointRef object.
-  We are now providing private header files as part of the
   distribution. The API exposed by these files may change or be
   eliminated in a future release. Use of these files may require the
   installation of the header files from other packages. The symbols for
   some of these functions may not be public, especially on Windows.
-  There are now enumerations for classifications (pdal::ClassLabel).
-  N-dimensional KD-tree support has been added.
-  There are some small API changes (const changes, for example), but
   almost all code using the PDAL library should build without
   modification.
-  We do not guarantee ABI compatibility, though in most cases this
   release should be backward compatible.

-  PDAL now requires at least version 2.2 of GDAL.
-  Pipelines can optionally be specified as an array of stages (without
   an encapsulating “pipeline” object).
-  The location of installed cmake files has been changed to match the
   cmake convention.
-  ``filters.delaunay`` now uses the delaunator library instead of
   geogram.
-  PDAL no longer depends on the GEOS library. However, some polygon
   functions will not work if PDAL isn’t built with a version of the
   GDAL library that has GEOS support.
-  PDAL now uses the standard cmake script to locate the necessary GDAL
   files when building.
-  ``readers.sbet`` now reads angles as degrees rather than radians.
   (#2354)
-  The ``tindex`` command now requires one of the subcommands ``create``
   or ``merge``. It no longer accepts the ``merge`` option, which has
   been replaced by the ``merge`` subcommand.
-  The argument for the function ``PipelineManager::executeStream`` is
   now of type ``StreamPointTable&`` instead of ``FixedPointTable&``.

Enhancements
============

-  All readers now accept the ``default_srs`` and ``override_srs``
   options. ``override_srs`` is an alias for the existing
   ``spatialreference`` option. ``default_srs`` applies only if no
   spatial reference exists in the source file. (#2194, #2195)
-  Added some dimension detection capability to ``readers.pts``. (#2317)
-  Hardened API use of LASzip in ``writers.las`` for points with data
   format 6 and above and set the extended_point_type variable. (#2320,
   #2329)
-  Support the ``libgeotiff`` path suffix when searching for the geotiff
   library with cmake.
-  Added a ``resolution`` option to ``readers.ept`` to limit the number
   of points read. (#2331)
-  ``readers.rxp`` now supports stream mode.
-  Added the ``invert`` option to ``filters.head`` and ``filters.tail``.
-  Added support for subcommands in kernels. (#2293)

New stages
==========

-  ``filters.mongo`` - Filtering of points using the mongo expression
   language.
-  ``readers.tiledb`` - Reads points from the tileDB database.
-  ``writers.tiledb`` - Writes points to the tileDB database.
-  ``writers.ept_addon`` - Adds sidecar data to an existing EPT dataset.

Deprecated stages
=================

-  ``filters.kdistance`` - Replaced by ``filters.nndistance``.
   ``filters.kdistance`` will be removed in the next PDAL release.
-  ``filters.mongus`` - Replaces by ``filters.pmf`` and ``filters.smrf``

Bug fixes
=========

-  The tindex command now uses sufficient precision when using the
   ``fast_boundary`` option (#2271)
-  ``filters.smrf`` and ``filters.pmf`` now process all points if the
   ``NumberOfReturns`` or ``ReturnNumber`` dimension is missing. This
   fixes a regression introduced with PDAL 1.8. (#2275)
-  The density command is now found by pdal. This fixes a regression
   introduced with PDAL 1.8. (#2378)
-  The ``scale=auto`` and ``offset=auto`` options now work with
   ``writers.bpf`` in stream mode. (#1983)
-  Pipelines with diamond shapes now properly re-execute ancestor
   stages. This fixes a regression introduced with PDAL 1.8. (#2290)
-  ``filters.crop`` now uses the correct logic when the ``outside``
   option is used in standard mode. (#2305)
-  A bug in ``writers.gdal`` with streaming mode that caused an improper
   location shift in some instances has been fixed. (#2292)
-  Added an explicit dependency on the arbiter library for curl. This
   fixes build issues on some Unix platforms. (#1822)
-  Fixed a bug in ``filters.icp`` introduced by a change in PCL (see:
   https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl/issues/2724) that improperly
   removed a function call. (#2319)
-  ``readers.tindex`` now provides a default of “EPSG:4326” for the
   ``filter_srs`` option. (#2316)
-  Points in buffer corners are now properly placed in tiles in
   ``filters.splitter``. (#2372)
-  Fixed reference counting in ``filters.python`` that might have caused
   a crash in some circumstances.
-  Generalized the python library re-loaded by PDAL when being used as a
   python extension. This is only relevant on some Unix distributions.

   been added to both commands to prevent the use of stream mode. The
   ``--stream`` option of ``pdal pipeline`` is now obsolete and ignored.
-  A new interface has been provided for the creation of plugins
   requiring less boilerplate code. There has been no API change.

================================================================================
1.5.0
================================================================================
Changes of Note
===============

-  PCL ``--visualize`` capability of the ``pdal`` command line
   application has been removed.
-  ``writer.derivative`` has been removed. Use
   `gdaldem <http://www.gdal.org/gdaldem.html>`__ for faster and more
   featureful equivalent functionality.
-  GeoTIFF and Proj.4 are now required dependencies.
-  ``writers.p2g`` has been removed. It was replaced by ``writers.gdal``
   in 1.4, but the P2G writer was essentially unmaintained and we will
   be using the GDAL one going forward.
-  ``filters.attribute`` was split into ``filters.assign`` and
   ``filters.overlay`` to separate their functionalities
-  ``filters.pmf`` and ``filters.outlier`` have dropped the ``classify``
   and ``extract`` options. They now only classify points and leave it
   downstream filters to ignore/extract classifications as needed.
-  ``filters.outlier`` has changed the default classification for noise
   points from ``18`` to ``7`` to match the LAS classification code for
   "Low point (noise)".

Enhancements
============

-  ``pdal pipeline`` now supports a ``--stream`` option which will
   default to one-at-a-time or chunk-at-a-time point processing when all
   stages in the pipeline support it. You can use this option to control
   memory consumption -- for example when interpolating a very large
   file with ``writers.gdal``
-  ``filters.crop`` was enhanced to support transformed filter polygons,
   streaming, and radius cropping.
-  ``readers.greyhound`` updated to support greyhound.io 1.0 release,
   with the most significant enhancement being support for passing
   downstream JSON filters.
-  ``user_data`` JSON object can be applied to any PDAL pipeline object
   and it will be carried through processing. You can use this mechanism
   for carrying your own information in PDAL pipelines without having to
   sidecar data. #1427
-  ``writers.las`` now can write ``pdal_metadata`` and ``pdal_pipeline``
   VLRs for processing history tracking. #1509 #1525
-  ``metadata``, ``schema``, and ``spatialreference`` objects added to
   global module for ``filters.programmable`` and ``filters.predicate``
   Python filters.

   ``std::stable_sort`` #1530 (Thanks to new contributor @wrenoud )
-  ``pdal tindex`` will now use data bounds if ``filters.hexbin`` cannot
   be loaded for boundaries #1533
-  ``filters.pmf`` and ``filters.smrf`` improved performance #1531 and
   #1541
-  ``filters.assign`` now supports
   `Range <https://pdal.io/stages/filters.range.html>`__-based
   filters
-  ``filters.outlier`` now accepts a user-specified ``class`` to
   override the default value of ``7`` for points deemed outliers. #1545
-  ``filters.pmf`` and ``filters.smrf`` now accept a
   `Range <https://pdal.io/stages/ranges.html#ranges>`__ via the
   ``ignore`` option to specify values that should be excluded from
   ground segmentation. #1545
-  ``filters.pmf`` and ``filters.smrf`` now consider only last returns
   (when return information is available) as the default behavior. The
   ``last`` option can be set to ``false`` to consider all returns.
   #1545

   ```writers.pcd`` <http://pdal.io/stages/writers.pcd.html>`__ has been
   fixed so that the writer actually compresses as requested.
-  The stage manager (and hence, pipelines) now properly recognizes the
   text reader as
   ```readers.text`` <http://pdal.io/stages/readers.text.html>`__.
-  ```readers.text`` <http://pdal.io/stages/readers.text.html>`__ now
   detects the case when a dimension has been specified more than once
   in an input file.
-  Fixed a problem where
   ```filters.splitter`` <http://pdal.io/stages/filters.splitter.html>`__
   could create cells larger than requested about the X and Y axes.
-  ```writers.nitf`` <http://pdal.io/stages/writers.nitf.html>`__ now
   errors if it attempts to write an FTITLE field that exceeds the
   allowable length.

   fail to properly order points depending on the implementation of the
   C++ sort algorithm.
-  Fixed a problem in pgpostgres readers and writers where a failure in
   a query could lead to a crash.


================================================================================
1.3.0
================================================================================

Changes of Note
================================================================================

- Command line parsing has been reworked to cause invalid options to emit
  an error message.  Stage options specified in pipelines and on the command
  line are handled similarly.
- The dimension PlatformHeading has been renamed to Azimuth.  When looking
  up a dimension by name, the string "platformheading" is still accepted and
  returns Azimuth.
- Errors detected by GDAL are no longer thrown as exceptions.  A log message
  is emitted instead.
- Well-known dimensions are now added to PDAL by editing a JSON file,
  Dimension.json.
- Linking with PDAL using CMake no longer requires explicit linking with
  curl, jsoncpp or arbiter libraries.
- PDAL now searches for plugins in the following locations and order by
  default: ./lib, ../lib, ../bin, the location where PDAL was installed.
- The '--debug' and '--verbose' options are no longer supported as stage
  options.  The '--verbose' option is accepted on the PDAL command line.  The
  '--debug' option is deprecated, and if specified on the command line is
  equivalent to '--verbose=3'.  One can enable logging programmatically by
  calling setLog() on a PipelineManager or a specific stage.
- pdal::Dimension types are now C++11 enumeration classes. The change may
  require editing any Stage implementations you might have and removing the
  extraneous ::Enum type specification.

Enhancements
================================================================================

- Pipelines can now be read directly from standard input.
- Files can now be read from Amazon S3 buckets by providing an appropriate
  URL.
- Many new filters have been added: filters.approximatecoplanar,
  filters.eigenvalues, filters.estimaterank, filters.hag, filters.normal,
  filters.outlier, filters.pmf, filters.sample.  Most of these are algorithm
  extractions from the PCL library, with the hope of eliminating the need
  for PCL in some future PDAL release.
- The PLY reader now loads dimensions that aren't predefined PDAL dimensions.
- A '--driver' option has been added to allow a specific driver to be loaded
  for a file without regard to its extension.
- The PDAL_DRIVER_PATH environment variable now accepts a list of locations
  to search for drivers.
- Beta release quality drivers improvements in readers.greyhound
- Beta quality implementation of Mongus and Zalik ground filter
- Experimental implementation of Pingel et al. ground filter
- writers.pcd enhancements by Logan Byers (binary, compression) -- requires
  PCL
- Docker images upgraded to Ubuntu Xenial
- Cyclone PTS reader -- readers.pts
- skewness, kurtosis, stddev, and variance added to filters.stats output
- Python API now available https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pdal

Fixes
================================================================================

- A failure that may have resulted when using filters.hexbin to calculate
  density in the southern hemisphere has been corrected.
- A failure to create the index file with 'pdal tindex' and GDAL 2.X has
  been fixed.
- The '--tindex' option for the 'pdal tindex' command is now a positional
  option as specified in the documentation.
- The icebridge reader now reads the X dimension as longitude and forces
  the value in the range (-180, 180].  It also properly uses the dimension
  Azimuth instead of ScanAngleRank.
- An error in writers.pgpointcloud where it ignored SQL to be run at the end
  of the stage has been fixed.
- An error that might incorrectly write values stored internally as bytes
  when written as a different data type has been fixed.
- A problem where 'pdal info' wouldn't properly report dimension names not
  predefined by PDAL has been fixed.
- A bug in filters.crop that wouldn't properly transform coordinates when
  provided the '--a_srs' option has been fixed.

================================================================================
1.2.0
================================================================================

Changes of Note
================================================================================

- The GEOS library is now required to build PDAL.  In earlier versions it was
  an optional component.
- Boost is no longer a required component.  Unless you are building plugins
  that require boost (notably PCL and Geowave), you no longer will need
  boost installed on your system to build or run PDAL.
- PDAL now builds on Microsoft Visual Studio 2015.
- The PipelineReader class has been removed and its functionality has been
  merged into PipelineManager.
- Plugin libraries now support Linux versioning.
- Naming changes have been made to allow packaging with the Debian release.
- filters.height now uses the dimension 'HeightAboveGround' instead of a
  dimension named 'Height' to be compatible with the filters.heightaboveground.
- Option names no longer contain lowercase characters.
- PDAL now works with GDAL version 1.9 and later.
- Stages created with the StageFactory are now owned by the factory.
- filters.dartthrowing has been renamed filters.dartsample
- 'pipeline-serialization' now produces JSON output instead of XML.

Enhancements
================================================================================

- Pipelines may now be specified using a JSON syntax.  XML syntax is still
  supported but users should switch to JSON when possible as the XML support
  will be removed in a future version.
- PDAL now can be built into a Docker container.
- Many stages now support "streaming," which allows control of the number
  of points stored in memory during processing.  See
  Stage::execute(StreamPointTable&) for more information.
- A basic text reader has been added.
- Added support for the dimension 'ClassFlags' in readers.las.
- The derivative writer can now produce output for multiple primitive types
  with a single execution.
- 'pdal info' now provides bounding box output instead of a more refined
  boundary when the hexbin plugin isn't found.
- Added 'pdal density' to provide a command-line interface to the
  filters.hexbin density calcuations.
- The icebridge reader can now load an associated metadata file.  The reader
  also now marks the associated coordinate system as WGS84.
- The stats filter now emits bounding box information in native and WGS84
  projections.
- PDAL command-line programs now (generally) check their argument lists for
  correctness and report syntax errors.
- 'pdal info' now provides spatial reference attributes in addition to
  the actual well-known text.
- Geometry can now be specified as GeoJSON as well as well-known-text in
  most contexts.  Geometry optionally provides Z-dimension output.
- Stage and plugin creation is now thread-safe (NOTE: Most of PDAL is
  NOT thread-safe, so tread carefully).
- Many, many documentation enhancements.

Fixes
================================================================================

- A bug in generating PCIDs when with multiple simultaneous PDAL executions
  to the same Postgres database has been fixed.
- Fixed a bug in generated SQL delete statements when certain table names
  were used in the writers.postgres driver.
- Properly escape quotes when generating JSON output.
- Fix an off-by-one error when writing data with the derivative writer that
  could lead to a crash.
- Fixed a dependency error during builds that could lead to a failure to
  properly load Python extensions on Linux.
- Fixed a bug where passing certain options to 'pdal info' could be handled
  in ambiguous ways.
- Fixed bugs in the reading of raster data using readers.gdal.
- Fixed population of the AIMIDB and ACFTB attributes in writers.nitf.

- Add 'output_dims' options in writers.bpf to allow control of the dimensions
  that should be written.
- Add 'all' keyword in 'extra_dims' options of writers.las to cause all
  dimensions to be written to either the standard or extra dimensions of
  a LAS point.
- Add filters.randomize to allow randomized order of points.
- Add filters.divider to split a set of points into subsets of a fixed number
  or into subsets containing a specific number of points.
