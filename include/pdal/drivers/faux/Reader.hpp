// The FauxReader doesn't read from disk, but instead just makes up data for its
// points.  The reader is constructed with a given bounding box and a given
// number of points.
//
// This reader knows about 4 fields (Dimensions):
//    X,Y,Z - floats
//    Time  - uint64
//
// It supports a few modes:
//   - "random" generates points that are randomly distributed within the
//     given bounding box
//   - "constant" generates its points to always be at the minimum of the
//      bounding box
//   - "ramp" generates its points as a linear ramp from the minimum of the
//     bbox to the maximum
// In all these modes, however, the Time field is always set to the point
// number.
