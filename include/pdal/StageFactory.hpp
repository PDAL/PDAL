// acts as a registry of creator functions.  The list is initialized with
// the core stages we know about (I wish C++ had anonymous functions.).
// We allow the user to add his own "external" drivers to the registry list
// as well.
//
// We use 4 different functions for each kind of operation, since we have
// 4 types of derived classes from Stage and they all have slightly different
// parameters.  That makes it kinda messy.
