This document describes the process for releasing a new version of PDAL.

General Notes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release Process

1) Make a release branch. Any changes you make to factilitate the release should be
   made in the release branch.

    ::

        git checkout -b 2.4-maintenance
        git push -u origin 2.4-maintenance

2) Build and run the tests. Turn on all the optional bits that you have support for in
   your cmake options..

    ::

        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake -G Ninja ..
        ninja
        ctest

3) If you have time, download or build the latest released Clang and GCC and fix any
   bugs or warnings that show up. Run the tests. If you're really brave, do the same
   thing with MSVC. Fix all warnings/problems.

4) Set Version Numbers. The only place you need to set the PDAL version number is in
   the project() function of CMakeLists.txt.

  - CMakeLists.txt
    * project(PDAL VERSION 2.4.0 LANGUAGES CXX C)

  - Update library version in CMakeLists.txt. Note that if there is no breaking ABI
    change (unlikely), you can just update the minor version number.
    set(PDAL_SOLIB_MAJOR 15)
    set(PDAL_SOLIB_MINOR 0)
    set(PDAL_SOLIB_BUILD 0)

  - doc/download.rst point to new release

  - Update the ``STABLE_BRANCH`` pointer in the GitHub variables at
    https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/settings/variables/actions


5) Write the `release notes. <https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/releases/new>`_

   - The safest way to do this is to go though all the commits since the last release
     and reference any changes worthy of the release notes. See previous release notes
     for a template and a starting point. If you find issues after making the release
     branch, add them to the release notes.

6) Make the source distribution. This requires docker. If you are doing a release candidate
   add an RC tag to the invocation. The version number is automatically picked out of the PDAL
   release. The package is based on the current HEAD commit.

  ::

      ./package.sh
          OR
      ./package.sh RC1

   package.sh will rename the source files if necessary for the release
   candidate tag and create .md5 sum files. This script only works on
   linux and windows.

7) Unpack the built package source and check that it contains the files you expect and
   none of the files you don't expect. Build the packaged source just as you would build
   the source in a github branch.

8) Drag and drop each of the release files you built as part of the package process
   into the github release you created earlier. Click on "Choose a tag" and enter
   a new release tag (2.4.0RC1, for example). Set the "Target" branch to the maintenance
   branch you created earlier (2.4-maintenance, for example). Choose "This is a pre-release"
   if you're doing a release candidate. Press "Publish release".

9) Email PDAL mailing list with notice about release.

10) Merge the release branch into the main/master branch. Make sure both branches
    are pushed to the origin repository.

11) Update Conda package

  - For PDAL releases that bump version number, but do not change dependencies
    or build configurations, the `regro-cf-autotick-bot` should automatically
    create a pull request at https://github.com/conda-forge/pdal-feedstock.
    Once the builds succeed, the PR can be merged and the updated package will
    soon be available in the `conda-forge` channel. If the PR does not build
    successfully, updates to the PR can be pushed to the bot's branch. Version
    bumps should reset the build number to zero.
  - Updates that alter the build configuration but do not bump the version
    number should be submitted as PRs from a fork of the
    https://github.com/conda-forge/pdal-feedstock repository. In these cases,
    the build number should be incremented.

12) [Optional] Update Alpine package

  - The PDAL Alpine package lives at
    https://github.com/alpinelinux/aports/blob/master/testing/pdal/APKBUILD.
    Pull requests can be made against the alpinelinux/aports repository. If the
    build configuration alone is changing, with no version increase, simply
    increment the build number `pkgrel`. If the `pkgver` is changing, then
    reset `pkgrel` to 0.
  - Pull requests should have a commit message of the following form
    `testing/pdal: <description>`.
