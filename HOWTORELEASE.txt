This document describes the process for releasing a new version of PDAL.

General Notes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release Process

1) Increment Version Numbers

  - CMakeLists.txt
    * set(PDAL_VERSION_STRING "1.0.0" CACHE STRING "PDAL version")
    * DISSECT_VERSION() CMake macro will break version down into
      PDAL_VERSION_MAJOR, PDAL_VERSION_MINOR, PDAL_VERSION_PATCH,
      and PDAL_CANDIDATE_VERSION strings.

  - python/VERSION.txt
    python/pdal/__init.py

  - Update SO versioning
    set(PDAL_API_VERSION "1")
    set(PDAL_BUILD_VERSION "1.0.0")
    * https://github.com/libspatialindex/libspatialindex/pull/44#issuecomment-57088783

  - doc/quickstart.rst has a number of current-release references

  - Increment the doc build branch of .travis.yml:

    "$TRAVIS_BRANCH" = "1.2-maintenance"


2) Update README to include any relevant info about the release that
   might have changed.

3) Update ChangeLog with git2cl

  * git2cl . > ChangeLog

4) Build and run the tests.  Really.

    ::

        ctest -V

5) Clone a new tree and issue cmake. The package_source CMake target is
   aggressive about scooping up every file in the tree to include in the package.
   It does ok with CMake-specific stuff, but any other cruft in the tree is
   likely to get dumped into the package.

   ::

        git clone git://github.com/PDAL/PDAL.git pdal2
        cmake .

6) Make the source distribution. If you are doing a release candidate
   add an RC tag to the invocation.

  ::

      ./package.sh
      ./package.sh RC1


   package.sh will rename the source files if necessary for the release
   candidate tag and create .md5 sum files. This script only works on
   linux and windows.

7) Update docs/download.txt to point at the location of the new release

8) Upload the new release to download.osgeo.org:/osgeo/download/pdal

  ::

        scp PDAL-* hobu@download.osgeo.org:/osgeo/download/pdal

9) Tag the release.  Use the ``-f`` switch if you are retagging because you
   missed something.

  ::
        git tag 1.0.0
        git push --tags


10) Write the release notes. Email PDAL mailing list with notice about release

11) Upload Python extension to PyPI

12) Publish JNI Bindings
    What you need: 
        - an account on sonatype (https://issues.sonatype.org/secure/Signup!default.jspa)
        - ~/.sbt/0.13/sonatype.sbt file with the following content: 
            credentials += Credentials("Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager",
                           "oss.sonatype.org",
                           "<your username>",
                           "<your password>")
    
    The description of the Sonatype publishment process (everything described below is in a java dir: cd PDAL/java):
        - Publishing snaphots:
            Snapshot can be published without PGP sign, it is published to a snapshot repo and allows immediate snaphot updates.
            To publish everything in a local repo use command:
              - ./scripts/publish-local.sh (publishes scala 2.11 version)
              - ./scripts/publish-local-212.sh (publishes scala 2.12 version)
            To publish everything into sonatype snapshot repo use:
              - ./scripts/publish-all.sh  
            Summary:
              - Run ./scripts/publish-all.sh and everything is available in a snaphost repository
        - Publishing releases:
            To publish everything into sonatype snapshot repo (stagin repo) use:
              - ./scripts/publish-all.sh --suffix="" --signed
               `suffix` defines version suffix (for example `--suffix="-RC1"`)
               `signed` means that jar would be uploaded into a staging sonatype repo with a GPG sign
            Staging means a special repository in a pre released condition. 
              - Go into staging repos panel: https://oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories (log in using sonatype user / pwd)
              - Filter by package name (pdal in our case) and select staging repo
              - Press Close button on the top of the table with repos. It would run packages 
                validation and will close staging repo in a succesfull case
              - After succesfull closing press Release button. It would be immediately published into sonatype releases repo, 
                and sycned with maven central ~ in 10 minutes and ~ in 2 hours it would be index here: 
                http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cio.pdal

            Deploying to sonatype using sbt official doc: http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Using-Sonatype.html
            Official sonatype guide with pics of (https://oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories) which answers the question what 
            to do after jars were published into a staging repo (in our case using ./scripts/publish-all.sh --suffix="" --signed) 
            Summary:
              - Run ./scripts/publish-all.sh --suffix="" --signed to publish everything into staging repo
              - Go to sonatype panel https://oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories and release the jar
              - Await ~10 minutes to have jars published on maven central
